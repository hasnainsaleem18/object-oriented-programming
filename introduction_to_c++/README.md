# Programming Tasks

This repository contains solutions for the following tasks:

1. **Convert Seconds to HH:MM:SS Format**
2. **Calculate BMI**
3. **Burger Order System**
4. **Half Diamond Pattern**

## 1. Convert Seconds to HH:MM:SS Format

This program converts a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds, and prints the result in the format HH:MM:SS.

### Requirements

- Input the number of seconds from the user.
- Output: `1 hour, 23 minutes and 20 seconds` for an input of `5000 seconds`.

## 2. Calculate BMI

This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) given the weight in kilograms and height in meters, and prints the result to three decimal places.

### Requirements

- Input the weight in kg and height in meters from the user.
- Output the BMI as a float up to three decimal places.

## 3. Burger Order System

This program asks the user if they want a burger. If they do, it further asks if they want an add-on of fries and a cold drink for an additional cost. The total price is calculated and displayed accordingly. The input is validated to ensure correct entries.

### Requirements

- Price of Burger: `500 Rs`.
- Add-on price for fries and cold drink: `200 Rs`.
- Validate input to ensure it is either `Y`, `y`, `N`, or `n`.
- Display total price based on user input.

## 4. Half Diamond Pattern

This C program takes an integer from the user and prints a half-diamond pattern using nested loops. The number provided by the user determines the number of rows after which the pattern will start to invert.

### Requirements

- Input an integer from the user to determine the number of rows.
- Print a half-diamond pattern based on the input.
